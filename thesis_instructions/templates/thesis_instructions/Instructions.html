<p align="center">&nbsp;The points you earn in a round will be converted to money at a conversion rate of <strong>100 points = 1 Euro</strong>. Hence, your decisions have real consequences for your earnings and, potentially, the earnings of other participants. You will start with 0 points and if your point total is below 650 points at the end of the experiment, you will still get paid 6.50 Euros. Therefore, you can earn a bonus if your point total is above 650 points.</p>
