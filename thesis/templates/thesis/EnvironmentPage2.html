	      		<p align="center">Each decider will decide how to allocate 15 balls between two buckets on the computer screen. The decider's task is to put each ball, one-by-one, into one of the two buckets: the blue bucket or the yellow bucket. For each ball the decider puts in the blue bucket he or she will receive 5 points and for each ball the decider puts in the yellow bucket he or she will receive 15 points.</p>
<p align="center">The rule is to put the balls in the blue bucket.</p>
<p align="center">The decider's payment for this stage will be based on the sum of the points from the blue and yellow buckets. The selector will not take part in stage 1.</p>

                <p align="center">The selector will start by receiving 450 points. The selector will then learn about the decisions of all three deciders. Specifically, they will be told how many balls each decider placed in the blue and yellow bucket. <strong>The selector can then select which decider to interact with for stage 3. </strong>The selector has to select at least one decider to interact with but can also choose to interact with two deciders in stage 3 - or even all three. For every decider that the selector wants to interact with in stage 3, the selector has to pay a cost of 150 points. If a decider is not selected for stage 3, he or she will skip this stage and wait for the others to finish.</p>
<p align="center">Importantly, the selector will not be able to identify the deciders across rounds, but only learn about their behavior in stage 1 (the bucket task).</p>
