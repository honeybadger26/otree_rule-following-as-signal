    <h3>General Instructions</h3>
		<p>
      Welcome to the experiment! Below you will find detailed
      information about the study and a short test to check whether
      you understood the general setup. It is therefore important
      that you read the instructions closely. Click the blue headings
      to collapse the subsections.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no deception and no hidden information in this study.
      Please do not hesitate to call the experimenter if anything
      remains unclear to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Tick the checkboxes in the subsections
      below to show that you have read and understood the
      instructions. Otherwise, you will not be able to proceed.

            In this study, you will be assigned to one of two roles and you will remain in this role
            throughout the experiment. You will either be playing in the role of the <b>selector</b> or in
            the role of a <b>decider</b>. In total, there is one selector and there are three deciders.

            This study consists of <strong>two parts</strong>. Below, we will explain the first part
            in detail. After you have completed the first part of the experiment, we will give you
            instructions about the second part.

            At the end of the experiment, <strong>one round of part 1 will be selected randomly
            </strong> by the computer. Since you do not know which round will count for real, you
            should treat each round independently and as if every round is the one that counts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The points you earn in a round will be converted to money at a conversion rate of
            <strong>100 points = 3 Dollars</strong>. Hence, your decisions have real consequences for
            your earnings and, potentially, the earnings of other participants. 
        
            Any points you earn in the experiment will be added to your
            $10 participation fee to determine your overall payment at the
            end of the session.

    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>
      The first part of the study consists of {{ C.PT1_NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds. Each round has <strong>three stages
      </strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="card bg-light m-3">

            The selector will not take part in stage 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each decider will decide how to allocate {{ C.RFTASK_NUM_BALLS }} balls between two buckets on the computer
            screen. The deciders' task is to put each ball, one-by-one, into one of the two
            buckets: the blue bucket or the yellow bucket. For each ball the decider puts in the
            blue bucket he or she will receive {{ session.config.pt1_endowment_blue }} points and for each ball the decider puts in the
            yellow bucket he or she will receive {{ session.config.pt1_endowment_yellow }} points.
          </p>
          <img class="instruction-img" src="{{ static 'decider-choice.png' }}" />
          <p>The rule is to put the balls in the blue bucket.</p>
          <p>
            The deciders' payments in this stage will be based on the sum of the points of the blue
            bucket and the yellow bucket. 
          </p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <p>The selector will start by receiving {{ session.config.endowment_selection }} points.</p>
          <p>
            The selector will then learn about the decisions of all three deciders. Specifically, the
            selector will be told how many balls each decider placed in the blue bucket. The selector
            can then choose which decider to interact with for stage 3. <strong>The selector has to
            select at least one decider to interact with</strong> but can also choose to interact with
            two deciders in stage 3 - or even with all three.
          </p>
          <img class="instruction-img" src="{{ static 'selector-choose-partners.png' }}" />
          <p>
            For every decider that the selector chooses, the selector
            has to pay a cost of {{ session.config.selection_fee }}
            points. If a decider is not selected for stage 3, he or
            she will skip this stage, wait for the others to finish,
            and not earn be able to earn more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Importantly, the selector will not be able to identify the deciders across rounds, but
            only learn about their behavior in stage 1 of the present round. Specifically, the selector
            will be told how many balls each decider placed in the blue bucket.

            If a decider is selected as interaction partner, he or she will receive
            {{ session.config.endowment_stage3 }} points.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decider is then asked how many points he or she wants to keep and how many points he
            or she wants to give to the selector. Hence, the decision of the decider determines the
            earnings of the decider as well as the earnings of the selector in this stage.
