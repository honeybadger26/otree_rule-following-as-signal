		<p align="center">Welcome to the experiment! Below you will find detailed information about the study and a short test to check whether you understood the general setup. It is therefore important that you read the instructions closely. Please do not hesitate to call the experimenter if anything remains unclear to you.</p>
<p align="center">In this study, you interact online with three other participants who are doing the study with you and are sitting in other cubicles. You will not meet any of the other participants, nor will you learn about their identity. Likewise, the other participants will not learn about your identity. Everything you do in this experiment will be completely anonymous.</p>
<p align="center">Importantly, this study falls under the no-deception policy of Leiden University. Everything will be executed as stated in the instructions. There is no hidden information and no deception in this study.</p>
<p align="centre"><strong>Note: </strong>Tick the checkboxes in each section below to show that you have read and understood the instructions. Otherwise, you will not be able to proceed.</strong></p>
