<!--Things that need to be addressed in the software. Please tag with "@done" as they are addressed -->

## Simon

- Various applications have names like "thesis", "thesis-instructions", etc. This is redundant and distracting. Can we do a global change to wherever "thesis" occurs in a program name, change it to "rfas" (rule following as signal)?
- Reference to amounts that can be earned -- are these based on variables or hard coded?
- Instructions page
	- 100 points = 1 Euro --> "1 Dollar"
	- Baseline of 650 points for earnings may need to be changed
	- Roles subsection
		- put "selector" and "decider" in boldface when they first appear
		- include a picture in this subseection, after first para -- "players.png" (temporarily stored in root level of this repository)
	- Part 1
		- Stage 1
			- Add image "decider-choice.png" immediately after first paragraph
		- Stage 2
			- Add image "selector-choose-partners.png" after the second paragraph
		- Stage 3
			- Add image "decider-allocates.png" after the second para
