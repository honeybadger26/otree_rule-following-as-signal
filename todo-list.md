# Todo list

<!--Things that need to be addressed in the software. Please tag with "@done" as they are addressed -->

## Simon

- Various applications have names like "thesis", "thesis-instructions", etc. This is redundant and distracting. Can we do a global change to wherever "thesis" occurs in a program name, change it to "rfas" (rule following as signal)?
- Reference to amounts that can be earned -- are these based on variables or hard coded?
- Instructions page
	- 100 points = 1 Euro --> "1 Dollar"
	- Baseline of 650 points for earnings may need to be changed, TBD
	- Roles subsection
		- put "selector" and "decider" in boldface when they first appear
		- include a picture in this subseection, after first para -- "players.png" (temporarily stored in root level of this repository)
	- Part 1
		- Stage 1
			- Add image "decider-choice.png" immediately after first paragraph
		- Stage 2
			- Add image "selector-choose-partners.png" after the second paragraph
		- Stage 3
			- Add image "decider-allocates.png" after the second para
		- Checkbox for all of Part 1 should appear after the Feedback sub-box
- Decider, Stage 1
	- add pictures of buckets over the buttons
- Decider, Stage 3
	- Decider should have the option to give up to 500 points to selector, and keep none for self -- as well as intermediate options (current list of options is constrained so can not give more than half away.)

## Toby


- Consent page/Explanatory statement
	- Consent page needs updated contact information
	- Reference to Euros need to be replaced with dollars throughout
	- Reference to earning credits needs to be removed.
- Payments: why is the baseline payment 6.50, when the MAXIMUM the selector can earn appears to be 5? That seems to ruin any incentive to pick a good partner... Or do they add earnings across parts  1 and 2?
- Instructions page
	- Part 1
		- Stage 2
			- Is it clear that groups remain the same for all 15 rounds? Should it be made more explicit?



Maximum earnings for a decider on a round:

225 + 500 == 725 (keep zero in dictator game)

If they follow rule, they give up 150

If they split fairly, they give up 250

If they don't get chosen, they give up 250-500, depending on how selfish.

Maximum earnings for a selector: 1500 if they receive 500 from all three. More realistically 750, if they get 50/50 splits from three.
