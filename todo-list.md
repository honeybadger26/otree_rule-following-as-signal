# Todo list

<!--Things that need to be addressed in the software. Please tag with "@done" as they are addressed -->

## Simon

- Various applications have names like "thesis", "thesis-instructions", etc. This is redundant and distracting. Can we do a global change to wherever "thesis" occurs in a program name, change it to "rfas" (rule following as signal)?
- Reference to amounts that can be earned -- are these based on variables or hard coded?
- Instructions page
	- 100 points = 1 Euro --> "1 Dollar"
	- Baseline of 650 points for earnings may need to be changed, TBD
	- Roles subsection
		- put "selector" and "decider" in boldface when they first appear
		- include a picture in this subseection, after first para -- "players.png" (temporarily stored in root level of this repository)
	- Part 1
		- Stage 1
			- Add image "decider-choice.png" immediately after first paragraph
		- Stage 2
			- Add image "selector-choose-partners.png" after the second paragraph
		- Stage 3
			- Add image "decider-allocates.png" after the second para
		- Checkbox for all of Part 1 should appear after the Feedback sub-box
- Decider, Stage 1
	- add pictures of buckets over the buttons
- Decider, Stage 3
	- Decider should have the option to give up to 500 points to selector, and keep none for self -- as well as intermediate options (current list of options is constrained so can not give more than half away.)

- Part 2 intro page
	- Add new para at end: "The rule is to place the balls in the blue bucket."
- Demographic survey
	- Gender question -- code it the same way as in groupreputation3 project
	- Add field of study options
		- Engineering
		- Medicine/Health sciences
		- Natural sciences
		- Business/Marketing
		- Social Sciences
		- Not a student
	- Remove "why did you participate in this study" question
	- Replace "How many experiments question" with "How many experiments in MonLEE question", same as groupreputation3 project


## Toby


- Consent page/Explanatory statement
	- Consent page needs updated contact information
	- Reference to Euros need to be replaced with dollars throughout
	- Reference to earning credits needs to be removed.
- Payments: why is the baseline payment 6.50, when the MAXIMUM the selector can earn appears to be 5? That seems to ruin any incentive to pick a good partner... Or do they add earnings across parts  1 and 2?
- Instructions page
	- Part 1
		- Stage 2
			- Is it clear that groups remain the same for all 15 rounds? Should it be made more explicit?
