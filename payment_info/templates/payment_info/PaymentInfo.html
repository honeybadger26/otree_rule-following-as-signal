        You collected {{ participant.payoff }} and earned a <strong>total of {{ money_earned }}
        during this experiment.</strong> Your earnings are based on two randomly selected rounds
        and are derived from your points in those rounds. If your point total is below 650 points,
        you will still get paid $6.50. Any points above 650 points are considered to be your
        bonus earnings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rounds that were selected for payment for part 1 and 2 respectively are rounds 
        <strong>{{ session.vars.rfas_payed_round1 }}</strong> and
        <strong>{{ session.vars.rfas_payed_round2 }}</strong>

        <strong>The experimenter will distribute a receipt for you to
        sign. Please fill in the correct amount and sign your
        receipt. Then quietly pack up your things and leave, dropping
        your receipt with the experimenter on the way out.</strong>
